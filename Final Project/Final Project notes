		Compute shader	
		{
			large vorinoi noise for biome types. 		//How to deal with black spaces left by vorinoi? 
			
			//colour ID for each biome					//as more than 4 Biomes will be used
			Doesn't work as gradients ruin colour ID system, 
				channel bool system allows for 10 biomes.
				or 6 with alpha. 
                        Use base unity vorinoi to colour cells
                        multi noise X cell mask 
                        use GetPixels(int x, int y, int blockWidth, int blockHeight, int miplevel); in c#
